POLITY AND GOVERNANCE
17,1.1. TRIBUNAL SYSTEM IN INDIA,"Why in the News? Recently, the Supreme Court (SC) ruled that tribunals cannot direct the government  to frame policy. More about News • Context:  SC was deciding on whether the Armed Forces Tribunal (AFT)  could have directed the government  to make a policy to fill up the post of Judge Advocate General (Air). o The AFT was set up under the AFT Act, of 2007. o AFT provide for adjudication or trial of disputes and complaints to the commission, appointments, enrolment and conditions of service  in respect of persons subject to the Army Act, 1950, Navy Act, 1957, Air Force Act, 1950. ✓ It can further provide for appeals arising out of orders, findings or sentences of courts -martial  held under the said Acts and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. • Court Ruling : SC held that a tribunal subject to the High Court’s jurisdiction under Article 226, cannot be permitted by law, to direct the framing of a policy  by the Government. o Also, SC said that making policy is not in the domain of the Judiciary. About Tribunals System • Nature:  Tribunals are quasi -judicial bodies . The objective may be to reduce the caseload of the judiciary or to bring in subject expertise for technical matters. • Constitutional Recognition: In 1976 , Articles 323A and 323B were inserted in the Constitution of India through the 42nd Amendment. o  Article 323A : Empowered Parliament to constitute administrative Tribunals  (both at central and state level) for adjudication of matters related to recruitment and conditions of service of public servants. o Article 323B:  Specified certain subjects ( such as taxation and land reforms ) for which Parliament or state legislatures  may constitute tribunals by enacting a law. ✓ In 2010, the Supreme Court clarified  that subject matters under Article  323B  are not exclusive, and legislatures  are empowered  to create tribunals on any subject matter under their purview as specified in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. • Composition of Tribunals : The presence of expert members (technical members) along with judicial members  is a key feature of tribunals which distinguishes them from traditional courts. • Jurisdiction : Each tribunal is given specific jurisdiction  to hear and decide cases within its designated area of expertise. o Some tribunals have appellate jurisdiction , meaning they hear appeals from decisions made by lower authorities or government bodies.  5                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Appeals: Appeals from tribunals usually lie with the concerned High Court .  However, some laws specify that appeals will be heard by the Supreme Court. o In Chandra Kumar Case (1997) , appeals against decisions of tribunals  were allowed in the division bench of High Courts. • Currently, tribunals have been created both as substitutes to High Courts and as subordinate to High Courts. Significance of Tribunals • Specialization : This specialization ensures  that cases are adjudicated by individuals with a deep understanding of the relevant legal and technical issues. • Speedy Resolution : This is particularly important in areas where timely decisions are crucial, such as service matters, tax disputes, and environmental issues. • Reduced Case Load:  By handling specific types of cases, tribunals contribute to reducing the burden on traditional courts, helping to address the issue of judicial backlog. • Accessibility:   Tribunals are geographically dispersed , with benches located across the country. • Efficiency in Service Matters : Administrative Tribunals, such as the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) , expedite the resolution of service -related matters for government employees. Concerns with Tribunals • Lack of Independence : Critics argue that certain tribunals might not be entirely independent, as their members are often appointed by the government. o This raises concerns about the potential for undue influence  or interference in decision -making. o In 2019, the SC reiterated that the lack of judicial dominance  in selection committees  of tribunals violates the doctrine of separation of powers . • Pendency of cases:  For example, in 2021 , the AFT had 18,829 pending cases. o The lack of human resources  is observed to be one of the key reasons for the accumulation of pending cases in courts. • Term of office: In 2019, SC stated that a short tenure of members  along with provisions of re-appointment  increases the influence and control of the Executive over the judiciary. • Lack of Uniformity in Procedures : Procedures adopted by different tribunals can vary widely, leading to inconsistency in the application of legal principles  and potential confusion for litigants. • Overlapping Jurisdictions : There have been instances of overlapping jurisdictions between tribunals and regular courts, leading to confusion and potential conflicts. • Concerns Regarding Technical Members : In certain tribunals, technical members may lack legal qualifications. Way Ahead • Enhance Independence : Mechanism for appointment and removal of members in tribunals , and tenure of their employment  should have adequate protection from legislative and executive interference. • Administration of Tribunals:  The Standing Committee  on Personnel, Public Grievances, Law and Justice (2015) recommended the creation of an independent body called the National Tribunals Commission (NTC)  for the administration of all tribunals in India. o In 2020, SC also emphasised creating NTC  to supervise appointments, as well as the functioning and administration of tribunals. • Timely Appointments : Expedite the appointment process for tribunal members to prevent delays in the resolution of cases and reduce backlogs. o A judicial impact assessment  would be helpful to determine the extra resources required to handle fresh cases resulting from the enactment of a new law. • Clear Jurisdictional Boundaries : Clearly define and demarcate the jurisdiction of each tribunal to avoid overlapping and conflicting decisions with regular courts. • Training and Qualifications : Ensure that technical members of tribunals possess adequate legal qualifications or receive training to understand legal principles, promoting a better understanding of the legal context. 6                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  1.2. FINANCES OF PANCHAYATI RAJ INSTITUTIONS (PRIS) Why in the news? Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) released its report titled “Finances of Panchayati Raj Institutions” . The report discusses the fiscal position of PRIs for  the years 2020 -21 to 2022 -23. About Panchayati Raj Institutions and their finances • 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act 1992:  institutionalised the PRIs at three levels i.e., o Mandate for setting up of Panchayats is provided by Article 243 in Part IX  of the Constitution of India. o Panchayats, being Local Government , is a State subject . • Number of PRIs:  There are a total of 2.62 lakh PRIs in India , with 2.55 lakh Gram Panchayats, 6,707 Mandal Panchayats and 665 Zila Parishads as of October 2023. • Constitutional Provisions for Financial Empowerment of Panchayats o Article 243H: Provides for finance for the Panchayats  by securing authorization from State Legislatures for grants -in-aid to the Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of the State. ✓ It empowers panchayats to  impose, collect , and allocate taxes, duties, tolls , and fees . o Article 243 -I: Setting up a Finance Commission (FC) every 5 years to review the financial position of Panchayats and make recommendations to improve their financial position. o Article 280(3)(bb): Mandates FCs to recommend measures needed to augment the Consolidated fund of the state and supplement panchayat resources  to the President. Sources of Finance for PRIs Internal/Own sources of revenue  • Tax Revenue  from Property tax on lands (other than Agriculture Land) or buildings or both; Taxes on Duties and Commodities; Service tax; Taxes on Profession Trades etc. • Non tax revenue  from market fees on persons exporting goods  for sale in Panchayat area; Fees on Registration of Cattle sold within the Panchayat area etc. Transfer of Funds from Central Finance Commission (CFC) and State Finance Commission (SFC)  • Tied Grants : Earmarked for specific purposes or sectors , like sanitation, education etc. • Untied Grants  (General purpose grants ): These are provided without specific conditions  or restrictions and can be utilised for  local needs and priorities . • Performance -based Grants : Additional funds granted to PRIs based on recommendations of CFCs and specific performance criteria . • Special Category Grants : These grants are additional financial support designed to address unique challenges or particular needs of PRIs in specific regions or contexts . Other Sources  • Transfer from Central Government and State Government under different schemes  like MGNREGA, PMAY (Rural), Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana etc. • Grants from internationals bodies  like World Bank, etc. Challenges associated with the finance of PRIs • Structural challenges : Inadequate financial resources, heavy reliance on grants from upper tiers of government; and weak infrastructure impede the functioning of PRIs. o Around 95 % of their revenues  come from grants by higher levels of government. • Inconsistency in data : Assessment of the fiscal health of PRIs is difficult due to a lack of data on their revenues and expenditures and a lack of skilled staff  to maintain data in standardised formats. o Audit reports have been generated for only 46% of Gram Panchayats for 2019 -20. • Tax revenue : Sources of revenue for PRIs are limited, mainly property taxes, fees, and fines. o They face challenges in raising tax revenue due to a limited tax base, shortage of staff and adequate infrastructure along with a lack of clear guidelines  for introducing new taxes. • Corruption : Instances of misuse of funds for personal gain have hindered the ability of PRIs to effectively carry out their roles and responsibilities.  7                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  o For example, Rs 1.58 crore was diverted from the gram panchayat account without prior permission from the panchayat body and higher officials in Vijayawada. • State Finance Commissions (SFC):  As per rural development and Panchayati raj report, only 9 states have been constituting SFCs regularly, and out of them, only two are active. Initiatives taken to improve financial ecosystem of PRIs. • e-Gram Swaraj:  It assist in enhancing the credibility of Panchayats  which would induce greater devolution of funds to PRIs as well as provide a platform for effective monitoring by higher authorities. • Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) : It is an annual exercise carried out  by Ministry of Panchayati Raj (MoPR) in all Gram panchayats and other local self -governance bodies where GP development plans are prepared in a participatory manner under people’s Plan Campaign. • Capacity Building - Panchayat Sashaktikaran Abhiyan (CB -PSA): It had provided assistance to the States/ UTs for capacity building and training of Panchayat Elected Representatives  to enable them to perform their functions, including planning and implementation of development programmes, effectively and efficiently. • Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA): It aims to strengthen capacities of institutions for rural local governance  to become more responsive towards local development needs, and efficiently utilise available resources for realizing sustainable solutions to local problems linked to SDGs. Way forward • Budgetary support : Increase budgetary allocations from higher levels of government to ensure PRIs have sufficient resources  to fulfil their responsibilities. Also, steps should be taken to diverse funding sources of the PRIs. • Skilling : Training and capacity -building of PRI members to enhance their financial management skills, ensuring effective and transparent handling  of funds. • Accountability : Enforce strict financial accountability measures, regular and independent audits, and transparent reporting mechanisms to prevent misuse of funds  and corruption. • Strengthening SFC : SFCs should be constituted timely every 5 years and reports should be tabled in state legislatures regularly. It can fortify the financial position of PRIs  and help them in better delivery of their responsibilities. • Awareness : Raise citizen’s awareness about the functions and significance of PRIs by encouraging their increased participation in local governance processes ."

These committees are in charge of enumerating, identifying, and allocating vending zones in a city. 8                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  o TVCs are to be heterogeneously constituted with at least 40% of its elected members being street vendors , of which one-third are to be women. • Survey of the Street Vendors: At least once every five years  for the issuance of a Certificate of Vending (CoV) to the vendors identified. • Ceiling limit on the number of vendors: It is set at 2.5% of the population of the ward or zone or town or city for accommodating the vendors in the respective vending zones. • Grievance redressal Committees: They are to be set up by the States under the chairmanship of a retired judicial officer  to maintain impartiality towards grievances of street vendors. • Period for the release of seized goods : For non-perishable goods,  the goods are to be released within two working days  and in the case of perishable goods , the goods shall be released the same day  of claim. Challenges associated with the functioning of the act • Lopsided implementation: Despite a decade since enactment  only 17 States have constituted Grievance redressal Committees for the welfare of the street vendors. o The TVCs are yet to be formed  in many Urban local bodies and existing TVCs also lack proper representation  in many states. • Ceiling on Number of Vendors : The act has set the limit of street vendors to 2.5% of the total population of the ward/city , which is inadequate for a major metropolis like Delhi, Mumbai etc. • Exclusion of Railways land and its premises : The act does not apply  to any land, premises and trains owned and controlled by the Railways , which is a huge business area for the vendors. • Lack of uniformity: Currently, street vending is regulated under municipal laws enacted by state legislatures and this leads to a lack of uniformity in its implementation. o For example, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation  issued a Certificate of Vending  based on domicile certificates till 2022, despite domicile not being a criterion under the 2014 act. Way forward For better implementation of the Act • Revision of the ceiling on the number of vendors : It can be increased in consonance with the nature of the city  and as per the latest survey of street vendors. • Ensuring adequate representation: Street vendors and TVCs as stakeholders while deciding any policy framework that impacts their livelihood. • Creation of Vending Zones near Railway Stations : This will provide more opportunities for the vendors and ensure more consistent implementation of the Act. • Integration with the Smart City mission : Including members from the Street vendor’s community in deliberations and formulation of  the Smart City projects . • Establishment of Model Vending zones  as ""Light House Projects"" by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, to be replicated in states. For the Welfare of Street Vendors • Issuance of Smartcards which integrate the details of Vendor ID cards and Certificate of Vending. • Sensitize police force and local body officials by including the Street Vendors Act in their training curriculum to avoid excessive actions over street vendors. • Publish Street vendors charter by every TVC specifying the time within which a CoV shall be issued, renewed and other activities to be performed.  9                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  1.4.

32,2.1. NON -ALIGNED MOVEMENT (NAM),"Why in the news? Recently, 19th Summit of the Non -Aligned Movement (NAM)  was held in Kampala, Uganda. More on News • Theme of the summit:  'Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence' • Kampala declaration was adopted at the summit. Under it, member countries , o commit to strengthen the UN  as the primary multilateral organization o agreed to make joint efforts to  realize the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) ✓ AAAA  provides a global framework for financing sustainable development  by aligning all financing flows and policies with economic, social and environmental priorities. o strongly condemned the illegal Israeli military aggression on the Gaza Strip  and called for an immediate and durable humanitarian ceasefire. • South Sudan became the new member(121st) of NAM. About Non -Aligned Movement (NAM) • Genesis : Asia -Africa Conference held in Bandung, Indonesia in 1955. • About:  NAM was created during the independence struggles  of Africa, Asia, Latin America and other regions of the world at the height of the Cold War. o A key role was played in this process by the then Heads of State of Egypt, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Yugoslavia, who later became the founding fathers of the movement. o The idea was to declare themselves as ""nonaligned""  from either of the two nascent military blocks (NATO and the Warsaw Pact). • Principles: ""Ten Principles of Bandung "" proclaimed during Bandung Conference were later adopted as the main goals/principles of NAM. (Refer Image) • NAM’s first conference  - The Belgrade Conference in 1961. • Membership : It has 121 members (including India) comprising 53 countries from Africa, 39 from Asia, 26 from Latin America and the Caribbean and 2 from Europe. o 18 countries  and 10 international organizations are observers  at NAM. • Other Key information: o The policy of NAM was based on the  5 principles of Panchsheel ( principles for the conduct of international relations, signed between India and China in 1954). o The NAM does not have a formal founding charter or treaty , nor does it have a permanent secretariat.  Challenges faced by NAM • Change in world order  from bipolar to a more complex and multipolar global system. • Evolving alliances in the form of  plurilateral partnerships such as QUAD, I2U2, etc. • Many NAM members  support ideas of socialism and state control; and are dependent on the US. • Regional organizations  such as ASEAN, SCO and BRICS address specific regional challenges more effectively. • Emerging global issue s such as climate change, cyber security, and pandemics. • Lack of leadership , internal disagreements, and a failure to take clear positions on global issues. • Approach of multi -alignment  presents a more pragmatic approach for contemporary geopolitical landscape.  14                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  Current Relevance of NAM • Reform and democratization of UNO : NAM advocates for expediting reform of the United Nations Security Council to make it a more democratic, transparent and representative organ of the United Nations. • Protecting Sovereignty : NAM countries support the principles of self -determination, respect for territorial integrity, non-aggression, and safeguarding the independence and autonomy of member states. • An integral part of foreign policy : Many developing countries like India still follow the NAM policy, as ‘independence of action’ in foreign policy  is enshrined in NAM. • Unifying force : NAM is still applicable as a strict measure to prevent colonization and imperialism of small and developing countries. • Platform for South -South Cooperation : It provides a platform for developing countries to come together and discuss common challenges and interests and exert influence in global affairs. • Promoting Multilateralism and Global Peace : NAM upholds the principles of multilateralism, diplomacy, and peaceful coexistence; o NAM’s advocating for democratising UN and condemning Israel’s war is a testament to this. • Rising importance of the concept of Active Non -Alignment (ANA): It embodies a pro -active attitude (instead of passive neutrality) which is aimed at solving problems and generating the much -needed solutions for the troubled world. Non -alignment vs Neutrality • Non -alignment is a political concept ; neutrality is a legal concept. • Non -alignment is not written into a state's constitution ; neutrality can be a permanent feature of state policy. • Non -alignment emphasizes an active role in world affairs, promotes friendship and cooperation with all countries, hence it is a positive concept. o Neutrality implies non -involvement, does not necessarily involve such positive relationships. Conclusion NAM needs to redefine itself  and reinvent its objectives in the contemporary world system. NAM continues to be relevant so long as there is exploitation, war, hunger, poverty and disease on the earth. 2.2. INFORMATION FUSION CENTRE FOR INDIAN OCEAN REGION (IFC -IOR) Why in the News?

Implementation challenges faced by IFC -IOR • Challenges in information sharing  such as issues with standardization, duplicative efforts, and differing organizational formats. This hinders the creation of a unified operational picture. • Data Fusion and Analysis:  Information sense -making poses a formidable challenge with member countries grappling with overcoming extra -regional influences and addressing domestic political motivations. • Trust and coordination Issues:  Multilateral collaborations often encounter challenges arising from restricted coordination scope or unwillingness to share data equitably. Way forward • Reciprocal Deployments : India should also deploy its ILOs in other nations’ centres. • Enabling coordination and standardization: Efforts at the global level can be made to standardize information -sharing patterns and create collaborative arrangements to reduce duplication of effort. • Continued Expansion:  It should expand its information -sharing with more countries in and beyond the Indian Ocean Region, to give the initiative a more global character.  16                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Enhanced Maritime Surveillance : Augment MDA to cover grey shipping (military) and dark shipping (identity -hidden vessels) at the surface level."

Innovation and technology  Accelerate innovation and beneficial technological progress  • Flows of data, IP and international students  powered an increase in cooperation until 2020. o Pandemic drove widespread remote working for white -collar workers  that supported continued growth in cross -border data flows and relatively robust IT services growth . • However, new questions  have arisen about how to work together to harness opportunities. o The race to dominate the frontiers of technology development has led to import and export bans on 5G network technologies , limitations on semiconductors and bans on some social media platforms. o The share of cross -border patents fell  sharply  to the lowest point in the past decade. Climate and natural capital  Support the resolution of climate and natural capital challenges  • Level of cooperation  has been rising steadily , due in large measure to an increase in commitments, but emissions also continue to rise. o Net-zero commitments in the private sector have also proliferated due to groups such as Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ). o Emissions intensity  (emissions relative to GDP) improved over the decade , reflecting advances in electrification, decreases in heavy industry and increasing presence of renewable energy sources. Health and wellness  Enable global population to lead longer and better lives  • Rose swiftly  in response to the pandemic , but appears to be settling back to historical patterns . o Maternal mortality rates increased for the first time  in three decades. o WHO’s Pandemic Preparedness Treaty  (to be considered in 2024) is a prime example of international cooperation in progress. Peace and security  Prevent and resolve conflicts  • Cooperation in peace and security has declined since 2016  and plummeted recently. o This trend is driven by a rise in forcibly displaced people, a surge in cyberattacks, and a recent rise in conflict and conflict -associated deaths. Report suggested following measures to foster global cooperation: • Practice coopetition:  Stakeholders should focus on identifying avenues toward advancing shared interest  that can exist despite competition  – a practice known in the private sector as “coopetition”. • Raise the capabilities of management:  An understanding  of both global connections and geopolitical realities  – and implications for the business – should be a core competency  for every multinational corporation C -suite executive (company's top management positions). • Think diversifying, not decoupling:  Greater diversification not only strengthens resilience, but also promote a more inclusive trading system and economy. This could further enable broader participation by various countries. • Promote innovation:  Commit to greater cross -border collaboration through o foundational R&D,  24                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  o international student exchanges, o cross -border patent applications, o simplified approaches to global regulation of frontier technologies such as Generative AI. • Bolstering cooperation to achieve interdependent climate objectives:  Spending must focus on creating incentives to deploy lower -cost solutions (e.g. solar/wind power) and reducing the costs of expensive solutions (e.g. passenger battery EVs; onshore wind power). • Intensifying pandemic era cooperation:  Global health norms and infrastructure established during and before the pandemic can be preserved to improve health outcomes, address future pandemics, aging populations, and chronic conditions. • Support for vulnerable populations:  By managing the integration of refugee populations from conflict zones, identifying mechanisms to support impacted individuals in conflict zones. • Cyber collaboration : Integrating public and private sector actors to boost sharing of data flows on cybersecurity threats."

49,3.1. NATIONAL MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY INDEX,"Why in the news? NITI Aayog released a discussion paper titled ‘Multidimensional Poverty in India since 2005 -06’. About Multidimensional poverty • It refers to a measure that considers various factors or dimensions beyond income  to assess and understand poverty. • Multidimensional poverty  encompasses the various deprivations experienced by poor people  in their daily lives – such as poor health, lack of education, inadequate living standards, poor quality of work, the threat of violence, among others. o Ending poverty in all its forms  everywhere, the aim of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 1 , entails viewing poverty not solely in relation to income and consumption, but as relating to other multiple capabilities. Measurement of multidimensional poverty: • The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI ) assesses poverty at the individual level. Alkire -Foster Method  is most often used to compute MPIs. • Global MPI (GMPI): It is a globally recognized comprehensive measure that captures poverty in multiple dimensions beyond monetary aspects. o GMPI Report  was first released by the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI)  and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) since 2010. o It covers 100 developing countries and captures the acute deprivations in health, education, and living standards that a person faces simultaneously. o If a person is deprived in a 1/3rd or more of ten (weighted) indicators, the GMPI  identifies them as ‘MPI poor. • National MPI (NMPI): It retains the 10 original indicators of the global MPI model and has added two indicators , viz., Maternal Health and Bank Account, in line with India’s national priorities. o MPI value is arrived at by multiplying the headcount ratio (H) and the intensity of poverty (A),  reflecting both the share of people in poverty and the degree to which they are deprived. ✓ Headcount ratio (H):  It indicates proportion of multidimensionally poor in the population. ✓ Intensity of poverty (A):  It indicates average proportion of deprivations which is experienced by multidimensionally poor individuals. o Under the government’s Global Indices for Reforms and Growth (GIRG) initiative, NITI Aayog is the nodal agency for MPI. ✓ GIRG monitors India’s performance on various important social and economic parameters. o NITI Aayog uses  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)  to measure the NMPI. ✓ The latest NMPI, ‘National Multidimensional poverty: A Progress Review -2023’ is based on the data of NFHS 4 and 5. Key finding of the recent discussion paper • Decline in MPI: Headcount Ratio decreased from 29.17% in 2013 -14 to 11.28% in 2022 -23. o 24.82 crore Indians escaped  multidimensional poverty in last 9 years. o Intensity of Poverty is also declining  which shows that extent of deprivation among the deprived population is falling. o The pace of decline  in poverty headcount ratio  was much faster between 2015 -16 to 2019 -21 compared to 2005 -06 to 2015 -16.   28                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Poverty declining across indicators: All 12 indicators  of MPI have recorded significant improvement. o Cooking Fuel  and Housing have the highest deprivation level of deprivation. o Child & Adolescent Mortality , Electricity , and Bank Account  have  the lowest deprivation levels. • Regional decline in MPI: Poorer states record faster decline in poverty indicating reduction in disparities. o Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Rajasthan  saw f astest reduction in the proportion of multidimensional poor. • Attainment of SDG: I ndia  on track to achieve SDG Target 1.2  (reducing multi -dimensional poverty by at least half) much ahead of 2030. • Factors responsible for decline in MPI: Various government programs including PM Ujjwala Yojana , Saubhagya,  and transformative campaigns like Swachh Bharat Mission and Jal Jeevan Mission  have collectively elevated living conditions and overall well - being of people. Significance of NMPI • Provides for  more nuanced perspective as it delves into deprivations up to the district level unlike conventional monetary poverty assessments  that is based on consumption surveys. • Facilitates targeted interventions to address acute poverty and uphold the principle of inclusivity. • Determination of overlapping deprivations that directly influence individuals’ quality of life and overall well -being. • Helps in more inclusive policy formulation. Issues associated with NMPI • Less sensitive : To be considered multidimensionally poor,  households must be deprived in at least 1/3rd of indicators . This requirement makes the MPI less sensitive to minor inaccuracies. • Impact of COVID -19: Some economists have argued that loss of livelihood due to reverse migration and deaths due to disrupted healthcare in 2020 -21 are not covered in the Index.  29                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Stagnant wages:  Real wages were stagnant for six years which had serious implications for consumption demands and this cannot be consistent with a decline in poverty levels. • Issues in reliability of Data: Way forward • Include new dimensions in calculating MPI: Like learning outcomes, social discrimination, unorganized workers, environmental degradation etc. • New measurement:  National MPI should incorporate 75th round of National Sample Survey (NSS) data along with"
50,NFHS.,"• Effective monitoring:  Comprehensive measures should be taken to monitor the progress across indicators on real time basis. o Also, social audit of the programmes, awareness generation about development programme, etc. is critical for eliminating multidimensional poverty."
51,3.2. UNIFIED PAYMENTS INTERFACE (UPI),"Why in the news? Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced new rules and regulations to enhance the scope of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) payments. More on news • About new rules o Enhancing UPI transaction limit: ✓ The transaction limit for UPI payments made to hospitals and educational institutions  has been hiked to Rs 5 lakh from Rs 1 lakh earlier. ✓ Transaction limit for UPI is capped at Rs. 1 lakh, except in a few categories  like Capital Markets  (Broking, Mutual Funds, etc.), Collections  (Credit card payments, Loan re -payments, EMI), Insurance  etc. where transaction limit is Rs. 2 lakhs . o Increased e -Mandates for Recurring Online Transactions : Limits for execution of e -mandates without Additional Factor of Authentication (AFA) increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 1 lakh  for credit card bill payments, mutual fund subscriptions and insurance premiums. About Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and its Features • UPI powers multiple bank accounts  into a single mobile application  (of any participating bank), merging several banking features  e.g., transfer of funds, etc . o It was developed by NPCI  in 2016 and built over Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) infrastructure. o It is the most successful real -time payment system globally, providing simplicity, safety, and security in person -to-person (P2P) and person - to-merchant (P2M) transactions  in India. New Features of UPI • Credit Line on UPI: It enables  pre-sanctioned credit lines from banks  via UPI.  Earlier, only the deposited amount could be transacted through the UPI System . • UPI Lite X:   Users can both send and receive money offline through any compatible device that supports Near Field Communication (NFC) . • UPI Tap & Pay: It allows NFC-enabled QR codes  at merchants to  complete payments, with a single tap without entering the PIN.  About National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) • NPCI is an umbrella organization for operating retail payments and settlement systems in India. • It is an initiative  of RBI and Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) under provisions of Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007. • It has been incorporated as a “Not for Profit” Company under provisions Section 8 of Companies Act 2013 . • It has launched payment products such as RuPay card, IMPS, UPI, BHIM, BHIM Aadhaar, Bharat BillPay etc.  30                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Conversational Payments : o Hello! UPI:  Users can simply give voice commands to transfer funds and input a UPI PIN  to complete the transaction. o BillPay Connect: Customers can  fetch and pay their bills by sending a simple ‘Hi’  message or by giving a missed call. • Other Proposed Changes for UPI Payments o Deactivate UPI IDs: National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has asked banks and mobile payment applications. like Google Pay etc. to deactivate UPI IDs and numbers of accounts that have been inactive  for one year. o The four -hour time limit  for users initiating first payments over Rs 2,000 to new recipients  to make UPI transactions safe. ✓ This has added a layer of control and security  as it allows users to reverse or modify transactions within that window. o Introduction of UPI ATMs , allowing cash withdrawal by scanning a QR code. Challenges associated with UPI • Regulation:  Expanding UPI to accommodate a global user base will require adhering to data protection, financial laws and regulations of different countries  posing regulatory and compliance challenges. o Also, significant scalability in terms of software, network and partner banks is required. • Dominance of Foreign -owned UPI Apps : Parliamentary panel’s report, ‘Digital Payment and Online Security Measures for Data Protection’ recently highlights that foreign entities like PhonePe and Google Pay dominate Indian fintech sector. o Market share of PhonePe is 46.91% and Google Pay is 36.39% in terms of the transaction volume in October - November 2023, whereas for BHIM UPI it is 0.22%. • Security and Fraud:  Cybercriminals may exploit vulnerabilities in the system  or use social engineering techniques to gain access to sensitive information leading to financial losses. • Exchange Rates:  Managing currency conversion and exchange rates while facilitating payments and loading money to the wallet poses a significant challenge for cross -border transactions. • Lack of awareness: UPI remains a barrier to its widespread adoption especially among individuals with a lack of familiarity with digital payments, leading to financial fraud. • Privacy and Surveillance:  The UPI system ensures end -to- end cryptography, but the regulator i.e. NPCI have access to details of each Initiatives to promote UPI • UPI for secondary market : Introduced by NPCI to enhance the ease of equity trading  in country. • UPI Chalega Campaign : Launched by NPCI to promote UPI as an easy, safe, and instant mode of payment. It also educates users about various features such as UPI LITE that enables swift low value transaction. • MoU between Google India Digital Services  and NPCI International Payments: To broaden use of UPI payments , enabling travellers to  make transactions abroad and ease remittances process between countries . • India’s UPI in overseas markets : Various countries like Oman, UAE, France, Nepal, Bhutan etc. are using UPI system for payment. • UPI 123PAY : It is an instant payment system for feature phone users who can use UPI payment service in a safe and secure manner.  31                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  transaction  Aadhaar number, device fingerprint, IP address, bank account numbers etc.  This potentially compromises privacy rights. Way ahead •  Regulation:  A collaborative approach among nations, partnership among financial institutions, service providers etc. is required to develop a uniform compliance  and regulatory framework among the partner nations. • Infrastructure:  Banks and Payment service providers need to expand their infrastructure in terms of software, network etc. to process higher transactions per second and accommodate a global user base . • Fraud Protection:  A collaborative effort between UPI service providers, banks, and users is required to identify and respond to UPI frauds. • Transaction limits:  Striking a balance between security and transaction flexibility is crucial to drive wider adoption of UPI across various sectors. • Education and awareness:  Training programs and easy -to-understand guides should be designed to educate the masses about the UPI ecosystem and mitigate associated concerns ."
52,3.3. NON - PERFORMING ASSETS (NPA),"Why in the news? RBI’s annual Trend and Progress of Banking in India report  for the financial year 2022 -23, showed that the gross non -performing assets (GNPA) ratio fell to 3.9 per cent in 2022 -23. About Non - Performing Assets (NPA) • A NPA refers to a classification for  loans or advances  of a bank that are in default or arrears . o A loan is in arrears when principal or interest payments are late or missed  and becomes an NPA  when the interest and/ or instalment of principal remain overdue  for more than 90 days. o GNPAs  are the sum of all loan assets  that are classified as NPAs. Reasons for Non -Performing Assets • Defective Lending Process : Improper selection and  lack of periodic review of the credit profile of borrowers ensuring their repayment capabilities can create NPAs in PSBs. o Due to a lack of cooperation with financial institutions , borrowers default in more than one bank. • Willful Defaults : Rising cases of borrower who have access to funds to repay their loans but still choose not to, and default on the repayment of the loan. Industrial sickness: Ineffective  management , lack of adequate resources and technological changes, and changing government policies produce industrial sickness. Therefore, banks financing these industries ultimately end up with a low recovery rate of loans  reducing their profit and liquidity. • Regulatory:  Flouting of RBI guidelines and non-compliance with regulatory directions  regarding banking operations by Public Sector Banks (PSBs), can lead to frauds and rise in NPAs.  Steps taken to reduce NPA • Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act) : It allows secured creditors to take possession of collateral, against which a loan had been provided, upon a default in repayment. • Debt Recovery Tribunals:  Established under the Recovery of Debts and Bankruptcy Act, 1993 provide for the establishment of Tribunals for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts. • Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016:  For reorganisation and insolvency resolution of corporate persons, partnership firms and individuals in a time -bound manner i.e. within 180 days or the extended period of 90 days . • National Asset Reconstruction Company (NARCL): It aims to reduce NPAs of banks, improving financial system stability and efficiency. o It is incorporated under the Companies Act 2013 with PSBs holding a majority stake . • Indradhanush plan  for revamping PSBs, envisaging infusion of capital in PSBs.  32                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Frauds by banker and borrower : The size of frauds in the public sector banking system has been increasing, though still small relative to the overall volume of NPAs. o In the first half of the 2023 -24 financial year (April - September), there is an increase in reporting of fraud cases in the banking sector to 14,483  from 5,396 cases in the same period a year ago (2022 -23). Impact associated with Non - Performing Assets • Economic growth:  Rising NPAs prevent banks from lending for other productive activities  leading to a slowdown in economic activity. It can further lead to a decrease in employment opportunities  and inflation . • Higher interest rates:  Increasing NPAs can lead to an increase in interest rates , to cover the losses, which can lead to an increase in borrowing costs for individuals and companies. • Public trust:  Rising NPAs led to reputational, operational and business risk for banks  and undermined  customers’ trust  with financial stability implications . • Pendency:  The courts are facing the problem of increasing pendency of cases, as the current set up of courts made to deal with the problem of debt recovery is not efficient  and does not have enough manpower  available to deal with the high influx of debt recovery cases. • Capital adequacy issues:  NPAs erode the capital base of banks . When NPAs increase, banks may struggle to meet capital adequacy norms. Other Highlights of Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2022 -23 • The consolidated balance sheet of SCBs grew by 12.2% in 2022 -23, the highest in nine years . • In 2022 -23, the combined balance sheets of Urban Co -operative Banks (UCBs) expanded by 2.3%  while that of Non -Banking Financial Companies  (NBFCs) expanded by 14.8%. • The rate of growth of the unsecured retail segment has outpaced total bank credit growth. o NBFCs’ double -digit credit growth was driven by the growth of unsecured loans which grew more than twice as fast as secured loans. • During 2022 -23, the total amount of fraud reported by banks declined to a six -year low , while the average amount involved in fraud was the lowest  in a decade. • The capital -to-risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR)  of SCBs reached 16.8%  at the end of September 2023. Concerns raised by the eport • Long tenure of directors, absence of comprehensive risk management policy  and deficient compliance culture in UCBs. • Concentration risks  of corporate credit in NBFCs and significant exposure of banks to NBFCs. • The top 50 exposures of Government -owned NBFCs constituted about 40 per cent of total corporate credit within the NBFC sector. • Also, all these 50 exposures were to the power sector, which faces multiple inherent issues. Way forward • Government support:  Adopting a comprehensive 4R strategy  consisting of the Recognition of NPAs transparently, Resolution and recovery value  from stressed accounts, Recapitalising Public Sector Banks (PSBs) , and Reforms in PSBs  and the financial ecosystem can reduce NPAs and strengthen PSBs. • Strengthen credit monitoring: Develop an early warning mechanism and comprehensive MIS (Management Information System) to enable timely detection of problem accounts, flag early signs of delinquencies and facilitate timely information to management on these aspects. • Approval process:  Banks should have an established  credit approval process, for new credits as well as re -financing of existing credits . o A comprehensive assessment and periodic review of the borrower’s financial health and repayment capacity should be carried out. • Institutional mechanism: To cater to large industrial and infrastructure projects and the need for long -term funding, new Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) can be developed . • Risk Management:  The banks can mitigate their potential concentration risk to a specific borrower group, sector, geography, maturity duration etc. which was not initially envisaged at the time of loan origination. o Encourage banks to diversify their loan portfolios to reduce concentration risk . Overreliance on a specific sector or type of borrower can lead to higher NPAs during economic downturns in that sector. 33                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  3.4. G -SECURITIES Why in the news? Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted the lending and borrowing of G -Securities (G -Secs) by issuing directions called RBI (Government Securities Lending) Directions, 2023. More on news • Government Securities Lending  (GSL) refers to lending of eligible G-Secs, for a fee , by the owner (lender) to a borrower, on collateral of other G -Secs , for a specified period. o Under GSL transaction, G-Secs issued by the Central government  excluding Treasury Bills  (T-Bills) shall be eligible for lending/borrowing. o Also, G -sec issued by the Central Government  including T -Bills and State Governments bonds shall be eligible for placing as collateral under GSL transaction. • Other directions include o Eligible Participants in GSL transactions as lenders of securities:  Entities eligible to undertake Repo transactions and those approved by RBI. o Tenure of GSL transaction : Minimum one day and maximum period prescribed to cover short sales. • Permitting lending and borrowing of G -Secs will - o Add depth and liquidity to the G -sec market, aiding efficient price discovery. o Facilitate wider participation in the securities  lending market by providing investors an avenue to deploy idle securities and enhance portfolio returns. o Enhance operational efficiency  of government bonds by insurers. About G-Securities (G -Secs) • G-Sec is a  tradeable instrument issued by Central or State Governments. It acknowledges the government’s debt obligation. o Such securities are short -term terms usually called Treasury bills (T- Bills) with maturities of less than one year (91 days, 182 days, or 364 days) or long -term called Government bonds or dated securities with maturity of one year or more (between 5 years and 40 years). o In India, Central Government issues both T bills and bonds or dated securities  while State Governments  issue only bonds or dated securities , which are called State Development Loans (SDLs). o G-Secs carry practically no risk of default  and, hence, are called risk -free gilt -edged instruments. • Other G -Sec includes Cash Management Bills (CMBs), introduced in 2010, a new short -term instrument  to meet temporary cash flow mismatches of the Government . o CMBs have the generic character of T -bills but are issued for maturities of less than 91 days . • G-Secs are issued through auctions conducted by RBI . Auctions are conducted on the electronic platform called the E-Kuber, the Core Banking Solution (CBS) platform of RBI. Initiatives taken for Government -Securities (G -Secs) • G-sec Acquisition Programme (G -SAP):  Under it, RBI conducts open market operations to purchase G -Secs from the market. o It helps the central bank in controlling excessive volatility faced by market participants  in G-Secs market. • RBI Retail Direct Scheme : Under this, retail investors will have the facility to open and maintain ‘Retail Direct Gilt Account’ (RDG Account) with RBI  to access its G -Sec platform.  34                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Draft RBI (Bond Forwards) Directions, 2023 : It aims to introduce bond forwards in G -Secs , a move that will enable market participants, particularly long -term investors, to manage cash flows and interest rate risk . o Bond forwards  mean derivative contracts in which one counterparty (buyer) agrees to buy a specific debt instrument from another counterparty (seller)  on a specified future date and at a price determined at the time of the contract. • Scheme for Non -competitive Bidding Facility in Auctions of G -Secs:  Introduced by RBI to encourage retail participation in primary market  for G -Secs and SDLs. What are the concerns associated with government securities? • Captive investor base:  A diversified investor base for fixed -income securities is important for ensuring high liquidity and stable demand in the market. However, currently, a large portion of G -Secs are held by captive investors such as banks , and insurance companies. • Operational challenges:  RBI’s Negotiated Dealing System Order Matching (NDS -OM) platform was not able to boost retail participation as it resulted in an artificial segmentation of investors in different securities. • Exchange rate management:  Inflows of foreign funds via government bonds can lead to rupee appreciation. • Liquidity:  The G -sec market lacks liquidity due to the non-availability of buyers for the security in the secondary market . It can lead to distressed sales (selling at a lower price than its holding cost) causing loss to sellers. • Major risks associated with holding G -Secs: o Market risk:  Market risk arises out of adverse movement of prices of the securities due to changes in interest rates.  This could lead to loss if securities are sold at adverse prices. o Reinvestment risk:  Cash flows on a G -Sec include a coupon every half year and repayment of principal at maturity, which needs to be reinvested. However, it poses a risk for investors as they may not be able to reinvest due to a decrease in prevailing interest rates. o Interest rate risk : Dated securities have a long -term maturity of 5 -40 years , and thus are exposed to interest rate risk,  reducing their relevance over longer tenure. Way forward • Unified market:  Unifying the G -Sec and corporate bond markets would enable the seamless transmission of pricing information from G -Secs to corporate bonds . Having the same regulatory regime for trade, clearance, and settlement of corporate bonds and G -Secs will result in economies of scale and scope, leading to greater competition, efficiency, and liquidity in markets. • Trading:  To facilitate greater investor participation and achieve ease of doing business , G-Secs should be issued and traded through the stock exchange mechanism. • Investment:  The government should issue G -Secs in demat so that demat holders (currently, more than 120 million and expanding) can easily invest in G -Secs . G-Sec-based exchange -traded funds should also be developed to increase retail participation. • Transparent fiscal framework:  Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) legislation should highlight a fiscal path to investors highlighting the steps to reducing government debt in a transparent and accountable manner to boost investors’ confidence. • Tax Incentives:  Providing tax incentives in the form of no tax to be paid on interest income generated from the G -Sec can boost the demand for the G -sec in the market.

What are the techniques for mitigating G -Secs risks? • Holding securities till maturity  could be a strategy through which one could avoid market risk. • Market risk  and Reinvestment risk  could also be managed through Asset Liability Management (ALM) by matching the cash flows with liabilities. • Rebalancing the portfolio wherein the securities are sold once they become short term and new securities of longer tenor are bought  could be followed to manage the portfolio risk . • Advanced risk management techniques involve the use of derivatives like Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) through which the nature of cash flows could be altered. 35                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • About SGGs o A guarantee is a form of contingent liability  designed to shield investors or lenders from the potential default risk of a borrower. o State governments  often authorize and issue guarantees on behalf of state enterprises, cooperative institutions, urban local bodies , and other state -owned entities. ✓ These guarantees are typically extended to lenders, commonly commercial banks or other financial institutions. • Concerns with SGGs o Fiscal risks: Guarantees can pose fiscal risks , straining state finances with unanticipated cash outflows and increased debt. ✓ Prudential level of debt -GSDP for a state is 20% , but non -disclosure of a high guarantee level understates a state’s debt -GSDP. o Moral hazards: Guarantees could create moral hazard , leading to the guaranteed entity to be sub-optimal in performing its obligation . ✓ Similarly , investors and lenders may be less motivated  to thoroughly assess project compared to traditional non - recourse project financing. Recommendations by RBI Report • Clearly define purpose for which government guarantees are issued. • Charge a minimum fee  for guarantees extended. • Fix a ceiling for incremental guarantees issued during a year  at 5% of Revenue Receipts or 0.5% of GSDP (whichever is less). • States should continue  to build up the Guarantee Redemption Fund or GRF  (established to cushion liabilities due to invocation of guarantees). o Participation from the states in GRF is voluntary , 19 states have already established GRF."

108,4.4. ILLEGAL MIGRATION,"Why in the news? Gujarat Crime Investigation Department (CID) is probing the case of possible illegal immigration related to the Nicaragua - bound plane carrying Indians, which was grounded in France. About Illegal Migration • Illegal migration refers to trans -boundary migration of people from one country to another without valid documents, using illegal means. • In Indian context,  as per Citizenship Act, 1955, an illegal migrant is defined  as, a foreigner who enters India, o without a valid passport  or other prescribed travel documents, or o with a valid passport  or other prescribed travel documents but remains in India beyond the permitted time period. Reasons for illegal migration • Economic Factors: These include poverty, lack of economic opportunities, stagnation of income , etc., that may force an individual or a group to look beyond their home country for better Economic opportunities. • Better standard of living:  Real or Perceived promise of better opportunities in destination countries. o E.g., the promise of ‘The American Dream’  still attracts lot of migrants both legal and illegal towards U.S.A. 60                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Human Trafficking networks: Smuggling of migrants is a highly profitable illicit activity with a relatively low risk of detection. o As of October 2023, 2925 illegal agents have been notified in India through the e -Migrate portal. • Political and religious persecution : This has led to refugees and illegal immigrants from Tibet, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Pakistan, and Bangladesh  finding shelter in India. • Overpopulation:  This may lead to crisis of living space . E.g.  In countries like Bangladesh where high population density has led to illegal migration in North eastern States of India. • Natural Disasters: This may force people to migrate for survival and better living conditions. o E.g., Illegal migration from Sahel region of Africa  due to frequent droughts. o Frequent floods and cyclone  in Bangladesh  force migration of people to India. • Existing Social Networks:  Social networks established by previous migrants attract more migrants from similar communities, often resulting in migration through illegal routes in absence of other options. Impacts of Illegal Migration • Economic Exploitation: Illegal and undocumented migrants lack legal safeguard  and thus are prone to informal, temporary or unprotected jobs and even forced labour. • Violation of Human Rights: Illegal Migrants are vulnerable to multiple inhumane conditions and criminal offences like assault, rape or extortion  during their arduous journeys  or at the destination region. • Risk of Detention and deportation:  Illegal migrants face constant fear of being deported by the authorities and may also be mistreated during detention. o E.g., Detention centers of US  for illegal migrants, are often alleged to have poor living conditions  impacting physical, mental, social health of detainees including children. • Social Tensions: Large scale illegal migration may distort existing demography  and pose a threat to existing socio - cultural identity. o E.g. Threat to Assamese identity  due to illegal migration from Bangladesh has given rise to various socio -political tensions in Assam. • Facilitates Organized Crimes: Often organized criminal groups are involved in smuggling migrants across borders (e.g. US-Mexico Border). Initiatives Taken to counter illegal migration • 'Surakshit Jayen Prashikshit Jayen' campaign:  Initiative of Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to raise awareness of using safe and legal channels while traveling for employment abroad. • Migration and mobility partnership agreements: Such agreement with countries e.g., France, seek to encourage legal and orderly migration, assure the return of identified illegal migrants to their country and combat irregular migration. • Border management: To restrict infiltration of illegal immigrants. Initiatives include, o Physical infrastructure in the form of border fencing, floodlighting  etc. o Comprehensive Integrated Border Management System (CIBMS),  a technological solution to improve situational awareness along border areas. o Regular patrolling and anti -tunneling exercise  by Border Security Force, Assam Rifles etc. to stop illegal infiltration. Global Initiatives • Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration: Global agreement under International Organization for Migration (IOM)  on a common approach to international migration in all its dimensions. o One of its objectives is to, ’Prevent, combat and eradicate trafficking in persons in the context of international migration’ . • Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, under the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC). • Organizations such as the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL)  support the efforts of national police authorities in breaking up the criminal networks behind the smuggling of migrants. Challenges in Tackling Illegal Migration • Lack of data:  Centre in an affidavit filed in SC held that ‘clandestine and surreptitious’ manner of entry of illegal migrants makes it difficult to have an accurate data collection. • Porous Borders:  It facilitates the flow of illegal migrants across multiple countries using Donkey routes/flights. 61                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Poor regulation of travel agencies: It has led to cropping up of unscrupulous travel and placement agents running illegal operations , particularly in regions where demand for moving abroad is high. • Coordination issues: Cross country dimension of international human trafficking networks  requires extensive International cooperation of law enforcement agencies. • Involvement of organized criminal groups: Organized criminals have established professional networks that transcend borders and encompass all regions. • Legal shortcomings : Absence or inadequacy of national legislation to address the smuggling of migrants in many parts of the world. Way Forward • International Cooperation: Transnational nature of illegal migration mandates an institutional mechanism for cooperation, data exchange, safeguarding human rights etc. in context of Illegal migration. • Combat human trafficking: Better coordination of law enforcement agencies under ambit of INTERPOL, to dismantle criminal networks behind human trafficking and migrant smuggling. • Capacity development of local law enforcement: To detect and prevent illegal migration and safeguard migrants in vulnerable situations. • Countering Organized crime: UNTOC  can help in addressing the involvement of organized groups. • Demarcate between Refugees and Illegal migrant: India, since ages has been a host to refugees fleeing politico -religious persecution. o However, there is need to have a dedicated refugee policy to deal with them in a non -arbitrary manner."

115,5.1. 50 YEARS OF PROJECT TIGER,"Why in the News? The Indian government officially marked 2023 as the  50th  year of ‘Project Tiger’. About Project Tiger • A Centrally Sponsored Scheme  of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC), launched in 1973. o Initially launched in 9 Tiger reserves (TRs)  in different states of India. o Provides central assistance to tiger range States for in - situ conservation  of tigers in designated tiger reserves. • Objective : To ensure the maintenance of a viable population of tigers in India for scientific, economic, aesthetic, cultural and ecological values. o Project Tiger has a holistic ecosystem approach. Though the main focus is on the flagship species tiger, the project strives to maintain the stability of ecosystems by also supporting abundant prey populations. • Implementing Agency : National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). o NTCA was launched in 2005, following the recommendations of the Tiger Task Force. It was given statutory status by 2006 amendment of Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. • Funding pattern : 60% Central Assistance  is being made available to States for expenditure on all non-recurring items. o For recurring items , Central Assistance is restricted to 50%  of the expenditure, while a matching grant is provided by the Project States. o North Eastern and Himalayan States  are provided 90% central assistance in both cases. • Project Tiger and Project Elephant were merged  as Project Tiger  & Elephant. • Activities undertaken under Project Tiger o Establishment and development of Tiger Reserves : 55 tiger reserves . (Veerangana Durgavati Tiger Reserve  and Dholpur – Karauli Tiger Reserve were declared in 2023) o Core -buffer strategy to manage tigers : Core areas have the legal status of a national park or a sanctuary. ✓ Whereas buffer or peripheral areas  are a mix of forest and non -forest land , managed as a multiple -use area. o Technological advancements : The e -Bird project  uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) for Surveillance and Monitoring. ✓ NTCA conducts assessment using the application M -STrIPES  (Monitoring System for Tigers Intensive Protection & Ecological Status). o Special Tiger Protection Force (STPF) : Deployed in several TRs for focused  anti-poaching operations. The conservation of tigers in India can be divided into two phases. • The first phase starting in the 1970s , involved the enactment of the Wildlife Protection Act and the establishment of protected areas that helped conserve tigers and tropical forest ecosystems. • The second phase began in 2005 -06, with the government adopting a landscape -level approach and implementing strict monitoring for tiger conservation. Challenges in Tiger Conservation • Habitat Loss and Fragmentation : Out of the approximately four lakh square kilometres  of forests in tiger states, only one-third  are in relatively healthier  condition (Status Tiger Report 2022).  65                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Human -Wildlife Conflict : As human populations expand and encroach upon tiger habitats, conflicts arise. • Poaching and Illegal Wildlife Trade : Poachers target tigers for their skins, bones, and other body parts. • Climate change:  Shifting temperatures are altering the habitats of tigers in the Himalayan States, Sundarbans and Western Ghats. o Climate change accelerates, and wildfires are becoming more frequent in ecosystems that do not typically experience a fire season. • Monitoring:  TR such as Mukundra, Ranthambore, Nagarhole, etc. are situated along the boundaries of the state, which creates an issue of monitoring as the animal moves from one generation to another. • Other : Tigers reserves are also threatened by invasive plant species  such as Lantana camara. Way ahead • Habitat Protection and Restoration : Strengthen efforts to protect and expand tiger habitats. o Establish and maintain wildlife corridors  to connect fragmented habitats. • Community Involvement and Awareness : Engage local communities  in conservation efforts through education and awareness programs. o Promote sustainable livelihoods for communities living near tiger habitats to reduce dependence on natural resources. • Anti -Poaching Measures : Enhance law enforcement and anti -poaching efforts with better training, equipment, and technology. o Collaborate with local communities to gather intelligence and report illegal activities. o Impose severe penalties  and consequences for wildlife crimes to act as a deterrent. • Climate Change Mitigation : Support research  on the impacts of climate change on tiger habitats and populations. • Public -Private Partnerships : Encourage private sector involvement in tiger conservation through corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives. About Tiger • A flagship species of India was declared a National Animal of India . • Habitat : The largest population is in India, with smaller groups in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, China and Myanmar. o India harbours almost 75% of the world ’s wild tiger population. • Distribution of Tiger population in India : Habitats ranging from the high mountains, mangrove swamps, and tall grasslands, to dry and moist deciduous forests, as well as evergreen and shola forest systems. • Significance of Tiger : o Ecological:   Tigers are both a Flagship and Umbrella species. ✓ As a Flagship species they are important for conservation and as an Umbrella species, conservation of tigers leads to conservation of other species. o Economic : Ecotourism and related industries. o Cultural and spiritual : Symbols of power, strength. • Characteristics : o Solitary and territorial animals  and an adult male’s territory may encompass territories of two to seven females. o Stripes are individually as unique  as human fingerprints. o Tigers are excellent swimmers."

The National Mission for Clean Ganga  (NMCG) under the Ministry of Jal Shakti , issued a notification to amend the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016 .   66                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  More about the news • The amendment allows NMCG to discharge the treated effluent with prescribed standards into the river Ganga after exploring the options for its direct reuse. o Earlier the provision was against the discharge of untreated or treated sewage  into the river by anyone. • The move is aimed at ensuring more water flow into the river  thereby improving its biodiversity. To know more about the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), kindly refer to Article 5.1. Namami Gange Programme (NGP) in September 2023 edition of VisionIAS Current Affairs Magazine. Sewage generation in India and STPs • The estimated sewage generation  from Class I cities and Class II towns in India  is more than 33,000  Million Litres per Day (MLD) and the current treatment capacity of STPs is just 18.6%. • STPs are facilities that treat wastewater from domestic, commercial, and industrial sources  to remove pollutants and contaminants before releasing them into the environment.  Institutional arrangement and initiatives for Sewage Treatment in India • As Water is a ‘State Subject’ under the Seventh Schedule (Article 246), it is the responsibility of the States/UTs to ensure the cleanliness and development of rivers. o National Urban Sanitation Policy (2008)  made local governments responsible for behavioural change, total sanitation, and 100% safe waste disposal. • The 74th Constitutional Amendment (1993)  decentralized the water supply and sanitation  services from the state government to the Urban Local Bodies (ULB) • As per the provisions of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986  and the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution), Act 1974, o Industrial units and local bodies are required to install STPs  and Effluent treatment plants (ETPs to treat their sewage before discharging into the river. o However, there is no specific act dedicated to the management of wastewater  in India. • Other initiatives  include components of the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation & Urban Transformation (AMRUT), Smart Cities Mission , Namami Gange program  and National River Conservation Plan . Challenges associated with STPs • Lack of Capacity in ULBs: To plan and implement sewage treatment projects within their administrative jurisdictions. o CAG audit (2016) in Jharkhand found that none of the sampled ULBs had a sewage network , which led to 175 MLD of untreated wastewater being discharged into open drains.  67                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Lopsided implementation by the states: 5 states ( Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, NCT of Delhi and Karnataka) account for 60% of the total installed treatment capacity. • Lack of specific framework : There is no specific policy at either the Central or State level  that incorporates treatment of polluted water or its ecological restoration. • Differences in discharge standards : For instance, Surface water body is regulated by 35 parameters  while wastewater for land application is regulated by only 10 parameters . • Low Compliance rate : It is found that only 23 % of treatment capacity  is meeting the consented parameters of State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs). • Low economic viability: STPs are highly capital -intensive  and usually take around three to eight years to break even thereby hindering private investments. Way forward • Establishing multiple monitoring points: Including sources, environmental systems, exposure pathways, and the recipients for better control of pollution loads. • Utilization in Irrigation : The Indian Agricultural Research Institute, Karnal , has researched sewage farming and recommended an irrigation method for sewage -fed tree plantations, which can be widely adopted. • Focus on alternative usage : Local bodies can focus on the utilization of treated sewage for non -potable purposes like horticulture, irrigation, fire fighting, industrial cooling etc. o Government of Karnataka  has issued a directive to utilise tertiary treated sewage for non -potable purposes, like all gardening, including parks, resorts, and golf courses. • Defining better and uniform water quality standards : This along with monitoring will detect pollution levels, trace them back to the source and estimate the impacts. • Setting up of underground STPs in land -scarce cities: This will help to eliminate negative environmental impacts like noise, odour, and aesthetics in a crowded city o For example, underground STPs  are set up in most heavily populated Chinese cities. • Implementing Nature -based Solutions (NbS): like artificial wetlands, planted soil filters, vegetated submerged beds etc."

INDIAN LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY MAP Why in the News? IIT Delhi created the first hi -resolution Indian Landslide Susceptibility Map (ILSM). About Indian Landslide Susceptibility Map (ILSM) • A landslide susceptibility map divides the terrain into zones  based on the likelihood of landslide occurrence. Key Feature of ILSM • Innovative Framework for High -Resolution Landslide Mapping : Embracing big data and use of multiple machine learning models with different underlying principles. o The map model incorporates 16 landslide conditioning factors  such as height, slope, soil composition, road distance, river proximity, vegetation cover, precipitation, etc. • High Spatial Resolution Mapping: Map has a spatial resolution of 100 metres with over 95% accuracy. • Multi -Class Vulnerability Classification: Divides India into Five Vulnerability Classes  (refer to map) . Key Findings of ILSM • Overall Landscape Susceptibility to Landslides in India : Map classifies 13.17% of India's geographical area  as susceptible to landslides. o 4.75% of the area  is categorized as  ""very highly susceptible."" o Geological Survey of India  estimates a slightly lower figure at 12.6%. • Regional Variation in Susceptibility : o Sikkim  has the highest percentage of land area (57.6 %)  susceptible to landslides. o Arunachal Pradesh  has the highest absolute area susceptible to landslides. o Kerala , among the non-Himalayan  regions, exhibits the highest area susceptible to landslides. • Identification of New Landslide -Prone Zones : Eastern Ghats show  landslide -prone zones identified by the map. o These zones were not reported  by previous models or government records. Significance of ILSM • Policy Formulation and Implementation : It serves as a foundation for the formulation and implementation of policies related to disaster risk reduction,  providing a data -driven approach  for governments and agencies. • Scientific Understanding of Landslide Dynamics:  Helping researchers and scientists  study factors contributing to landslides  and refine prediction models. • Early Warning and Preparedness : The map provides crucial information for identifying areas with high susceptibility to landslides , enabling early warning systems and preparedness measures.   71                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  About Landslide • Phenomena: Landslides occur when gravity forces  pushing on hill slope material exceed  the frictional forces holding the material  in place, causing slope failure. o Landslide susceptibility  represents this potential for slope failure. o Due to steep slopes and heavy rainfall  most of the landslides occur in the northwest Himalayas followed by the northeast Himalayas  and the Western Ghats. • Causes: Landslides are caused by complex interactions  of geological, geomorphological, hydrological, and meteorological characteristics. o Geological Factors Influencing Landslides in the Himalayas: The Himalayas are composed of sedimentary rocks which are prone to denudation and erosion . ✓ Steep slopes and rapid rivers  contribute to toe erosion  making the slope unstable. ✓ Most of the landslides  in the Himalayas are rockfalls . o Geological Dynamics of Landslides in the Western Ghats: The presence of basalt rocks  and gentle -sloped rivers in the Western Ghats resulted in fewer rockfalls. However, weathering due to heavy rainfall has led to the development of a thick layer of regolith, thereby leading to mudslides. o Role of Rainfall in Landslide Triggering: Rainfall intensity and duration  as critical factors for landslide initiation. ✓ Western Ghats require less rainfall  to trigger landslides when compared to the Himalayas due to the high soil depth in Western Ghats . ✓ High soil depth allows more water retention  and an increased porewater pressure  ultimately leading to landslides. o Anthropogenic Contributions to Landslide Risk: Road development and construction  contribute to slope instability . Initiatives Taken by India • National Landslide Risk Management Strategy released by National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA): The strategy document brings out the message of the need to strengthen and mainstream landslide disaster preparedness, mitigation, response and relief mechanisms through o Landslide Hazard Zonation : It covers aspects of reliability and validation of landslide zoning maps in the Indian scenario and proposes a plan of activities for landslide zoning. o Landslide Monitoring and Early Warning System o Awareness generation  and capacity building o Preparation of Mountain Zone Regulations  and Policies o Stabilization and Mitigation of Landslide and Creation of Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)  for Landslide Management • National Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (NLSM) Programme:  Launched in 2014 -15, under it Geological Survey of India has completed landslide susceptibility mapping of 4.3 lakh sq. km. of landslide -prone areas in the country. • Landslide Atlas of India: The database covers  landslide -vulnerable regions in 17 states and 2 UTs of India  in the Himalayas and Western Ghats. o Prepared by National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) of ISRO. Conclusion Adopting area -specific measures  is crucial for landslide prevention . Enforce restrictions on construction, roads, and dams  in vulnerable areas. Complement with positive actions like large -scale afforestation , bund construction  for water flow control, and encourage terrace farming  in northeastern hill states where Jhumming (Slash and Burn/Shifting Cultivation) is practised.  72                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  5.6.

SOCIAL ISSUES"
155,6.1. SOCIALISM IN INDIA,"Why in the News? Eminent Socialist leader and former Chief Minister of Bihar Karpoori Thakur has been conferred with Bharat Ratna, posthumously. Contribution of Karpoori Thakur towards Socialism in India • Social Justice o Implemented Mungerilal Lal Commission's recommendations  to provide for reservations for backward castes in public employment and government educational institutions. ✓ Split backward castes in two blocs  (sub -categorization) to ensure social justice within backward communities (popularly known as 'Karpoori Formula' ). ✓ It set the stage for implementation of Mandal Commission report . o Implemented 3% reservations for women and another 3% for poor segments of upper castes  which was later struck down by the judiciary. o Conducted Panchayati Raj elections in 1978 , to reconfigure upper caste hegemony in rural power structure. (Next Panchayati Raj elections in Bihar were held only in 2001.) • Education o Abolished English language being compulsory for school students , to enable deprived people to move up. o Made teaching of Hindi mandatory for Christian missionary schools . o Did away with fee for children from a weaker economic background . • Credited with enforcing total prohibition of alcohol in Bihar in 1970 . About Socialism • Socialism deals with principles which envisage the establishment of a society  where all individuals enjoy equality  in different walks of life – economic, political, social, etc. • Two types  of socialism: Revolutionary  (Marxian) socialism and Evolutionary  socialism. o Revolutionary: Holds that socialism can be brought about only by violent revolution by abolishing private property and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. o Evolutionary: Believes social forces wishing to bring socialism should help organs of the state to form policies which are socialistic and should get them implemented. • Prominent Indian socialist leaders  include Acharya Narendra Dev, Jaya Prakash Narayan, and Ram Manohar Lohia, among others. o Acharya Narendra Dev's  visit to address a peasant rally at Waini motivated Karpoori Thakur  to join the freedom movement and Socialist politics. Contributions of Socialist politics in India • Pre – independence o Socialist ideals like anti -colonialism, equality, social justice, etc., provided an ideological framework for freedom struggle . o Socialist leaders and organizations played a prominent role in grassroots mobilization  and organizing workers, peasants, and marginalized communities in the nationalist movement. • Post – independence o Constitutional: Ideals of equality and social justice enshrined in the Constitution are inspired by socialist principles. o Strengthening democracy: Socialist leaders, parties, and movements led to the emergence of regional political parties which played a crucial role in strengthening the Indian democratic system. ✓ Socialist parties and movements consistently critiqued dominant socio -economic structures  holding the state accountable and pushing for reforms. 83                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  o Economic policy: Socialist policies emphasized on role of the state in the development of key sectors  like steel, energy, heavy industries, etc. ✓ This led to the development of the Mahalanobis Plan under the Second Five -Year Plan  (1956 - 61) and creation of Public Sector Enterprises (PSEs) . o Social welfare: Socialist principles influenced establishment of different welfare programmes  for weaker and marginalized sections such as Public Distribution System, reservation policies, etc. ✓ Different socialist movements  like the Bhoodan movement by Acharya Vinobha Bhave  not just directly benefitted the underprivileged but also affected the country’s policies and schemes such as land reforms . Contemporary Relevance of Socialism in India • Economic inequality: Addressing stark economic equality needs emphasis on socialist principles such as wealth redistribution, guaranteed access to basic necessities, etc. o e.g., Mandatory Corporate Social Responsibility and Progressive taxation policy  are, in essence, a reflection of socialist ideals in the economic sphere. • Issues with Capitalism: Market -driven model of growth is associated with different sets of issues such as exploitation of labour, environmental degradation , etc. o In such a context, socialism can prove to be an alternative to promote collective well -being  over individual profits. • Social justice imperative: Persistent social issues such as caste discrimination, disparity in access to basic amenities like health and education, etc., call for the inclusion of socialist principles in state policies. Contemporary Challenges for Socialism • LPG reforms: Economic liberalization under LPG (Liberalization, Privatization, and Globalization) reforms in the early 1990s resulted in a shift socialist policy of the past towards a more market -oriented approach . o Integration of the Indian economy with the Global economy  resulted in greater emphasis on the need to participate in global trade and attract foreign investment. • Adverse economic precedents: Stagnant growth rate (around 4% - termed by some scholars as ‘Hindu Rate of Growth’ ) during the pre -LPG reforms era. o Economic and business activities during that era were characterized by License -Quota -Permit Raj  which resulted in rent -seeking activities, and inefficient performance of PSEs , among others. • Political: Fragmented political ecosystem with the emergence of stronger regional parties and deviation from ideologies for electoral gains. • Socio -cultural: Growing middle -class aspirations for material prosperity make individual aspirations as incompatible with the collective well -being advocated by socialism. Way Forward • Balancing socialism with market economy: Strike an effective balance between state intervention and market mechanisms to achieve inclusive and sustainable development. o Promote a socially responsive market economy by ensuring effective implementation of concepts like Corporate Social Responsibility, ESG, etc., in corporate governance. • Strengthen public sector efficiency: By enhancing transparency, improving accountability, and reducing the bureaucratic red tape to curb corruption and enhance the effectiveness of service delivery to citizens. • Encourage democratic socialism: Through participatory decision -making and civic engagement in policymaking to reflect diverse needs and aspirations in policies of the State. o Harness technology , such as digital platforms, for efficient governance, citizen engagement, and empowering marginalized communities.    84                                                                                         www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  6.2.

Induction Charging (IC) also known as wireless charging is method of charging in which electromagnetic fields  are used to transfer energy between two coils without the need of a physical connection. Processes Involved/Working • The transmission of electricity generally takes place by either of the two methods: o By electric fields  using capacitive coupling between metal electrodes (capacitive charging) or o By magnetic fields using inductive coupling between coils of wire (inductive charging). • The most extensively utilised wireless technology is inductive charging. • The operating principle is similar to that of a transformer and is  based on the laws of magnetic induction. • One coil is in the charging station and the other is in in the EV and the energy is transferred from transmitting coils to the receiving coils. • A primary circuit , called a transmitter, generates a time - varying magnetic field. • A secondary circuit  receives this field, called the receiver, which is connected to the device to be powered. • To start charging, drivers only need to park their EV above the charging pad. Types of Inductive charging IC is mainly classified into three types: • Static or stationary charging (used at homes, office) o In this method of charging, the EV does not move while being charged . It is used when EV is parked for a long time. o Used at homes, workplaces, public parking, garages etc. •  Quasi -dynamic or opportunistic charging o This process permits an EV to get charged while traveling at low speeds and during momentary pauses. o Used at intersections, traffic signals, bus stops etc. • Dynamic EV Charging (Roads and Highways) o In this method, owners can charge their EVs continuously as they go. It allows owners to drive long distances without having to stop for charging or risk running out of power o Used for long distances, inter -city trips, highways, expressways with restricted accessibility to stops etc. Benefits of Induction charging • Reduces time and efforts: The technology enables EV owners to simply park their vehicles over a charging pad, reducing the time and effort required to plug in and charge. • Convenience: It eliminates the need to handle charging cables, making the process more user -friendly and less time - consuming . • Reduced Maintenance: With no physical connectors, there’s less wear and tear on charging equipment, leading to lower maintenance costs in the long run. • All-Weather Charging: As there are no exposed electrical connections, wireless charging is suitable for all weather conditions, ensuring uninterrupted charging experiences. • Help in meeting CO 2 emission reduction targets  by accelerating the adoption of e -mobility and supporting the deployment of e -buses. • Supports the development of autonomous driving technology:  Wireless charging is well suited for autonomous electric vehicles, as it allows for seamless charging without human intervention   101                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  Challenges in adoption of the technology Although, wireless EV charging offers various benefits, there are some challenges which need to be overcome before its widespread adoption and implementation. These are: • High costs: Wireless charging systems are currently more expensive than conventional charging stations. • Efficiency:  Wireless charging systems typically experience lower efficiency than traditional wired charging due to energy losses during induction . This could lead to longer charging times and higher energy consumption. • Interoperability issues : Additional efforts are needed to bring in fully scale interoperable operation among various kinds of transmitter and receiver pad designs with the roads o In addition, the method of pad integration with both the vehicle and road is an open question that requires extensive engineering effort. • Durability : As these charging systems will be implemented outdoor for general use, so they need to be robust to withstand the harsh environmental and extreme operating conditions. • Safety Concerns associated with shielding designs,  heat produced in metallic objects next to the system. o Also, living object detection method is required to prevent pets and animals accessing the hot region during operation. • Technologies concerns: It is necessary to achieve the development of the sensor systems and controllers that are used to detect EVs on the highways to charge batteries without errors to increase total system efficiency. Way Forward • Proper research is required to assess impacts on health caused due to long -term exposure to weak electric and magnetic fields, • Mechanisms to detect living and foreign objects  in the proximity of induction charging systems needs to be built. • Collaboration between government agencies, automakers, and tech companies  will be crucial to drive innovation, reduce costs, and improve efficiency, making wireless charging a viable solution for India’s EV landscape."

About the survey • The survey has mapped the patients treated across 15 States and two Union Territories between November 2021 and April 2022. • Key Findings : o Empirical prescriptions:  94% of patients surveyed were given antibiotics before medical diagnosis of cause of infection. o Preventive usage:  55% of patients were prescribed antibiotics for preventive indications, while 45% for therapeutic indications. o High prevalence of antibiotic usage: At 71.9% . o Classification of prescriptions based on AWaRe groups:  57% from watch groups, 38% from access group and 2% from reserve group. ✓ 3% of the prescription from not recommended group. o Only 8 out of 20 institutes  surveyed have an antibiotic policy in place. • The high use of watch group antibiotics raises concern as these antibiotics have a higher potential to develop antibiotic resistance.  102                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  About Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) • AMR happens when germs like bacteria and fungi develop the ability to defeat the drugs  designed to kill them. o While some  microorganisms are naturally resistant to a certain type of antimicrobials, they can also acquire resistance genes, whether by spontaneous mutation or through genetic exchange. • Reasons behind increasing incidence of Antimicrobial resistance o Overuse and misuse of antimicrobials among humans and in poultry and farm animals. o Poor infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings o Effluents discharge from hospitals, industries, and urban settlements ✓ Over 75% of administered antibiotics are excreted unmetabolized in urine and faeces and enter into sewage systems and water bodies. o Confusion over treatment guidelines. ✓ E.g., the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for common infections like pneumonia was not established for decades. Implications of the Spread of Antimicrobial Resistance • Healthcare Impact: Increased mortality and morbidity, and prolonged illness because infections caused by resistant microorganisms are often more difficult to treat. • Increased Healthcare Costs: Longer hospital stays, additional diagnostic tests, and more expensive second -line or third -line antibiotics leads to increased expenditure. • Economic impact: Working hours lost due to prolonged illness and increase in out -of-pocket expenditure. o If not controlled,  antimicrobial resistance  will result in US$ 1 trillion to 3.4 trillion annual losses to gross domestic product (GDP)  by 2030. (World Bank) • Increased risk of outbreaks : As current medicines become ineffective, infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of spreading to others. • Limited new options for treatment: There are limited new antibiotics in the research and development pipeline. Measures taken to address AMR National • National Program on AMR containment: Launched  during 12th FYP in 2012 -17 to carry out surveillance of antimicrobial usage in healthcare settings . o It is coordinated by National Centre for Disease Control. • National Action Plan on AMR (NAP – AMR), 2017:  Focuses on One Health approach and involving various stakeholder ministries/departments.  103                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • National AMR surveillance network of state medical college labs (NARS -Net):  To generate quality data on AMR for priority bacterial pathogens of public health importance. • Red Line awareness campaign: Urging people not to use medicines marked with a red vertical line, including antibiotics, without a doctor’s prescription. • Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945: Antibiotics included in Schedule H1 of the rules are required to be sold by retail only under the prescription of a Registered Medical Practitioner. • Ban on inappropriate fixed dose combinations (FDCs). • Operation AMRITH  (AMR Intervention For Total Health) launched by Kerala to detect the over -the-counter sales of antibiotics without a doctor’s prescription . o In 2018 , Kerala became the first state in India to come up with the Kerala Anti - Microbial Resistance Strategic Action Plan (KARSAP),  which is aligned with India’s NAP – AMR .

The Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) has allowed companies to manufacture and market five fixed dose combinations (FDCs) that were banned last year. More on News • These five drugs are allowed to manufacture and sale with certain conditions  which include o Providing safety and efficacy data  on three drugs within one year. o Two need their dosage and information labels adjusted . • Earlier, in a similar move, Central government banned 344 combinations in 2016 , citing public interest.   104                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  About Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) Drugs • As per Rule 122 -E of Drugs & Cosmetics Rule 1945 , FDCs refer to products containing two or more active ingredients used for a particular indication(s). • An FDC is a new drug when it meets two conditions o It combines two or more drugs already approved  for individual use in a fixed ratio. o It alters the ratio of drugs in an already approved FDC , along with making changes to its claims • Mostly FDCs are in combinations of cough, cold, and fever preparations ; antimicrobials; vitamins and minerals etc. • In 2015, out of 376 entities, 24 entities were FDCs in National List of Essential Medicine. Rationale for Usage of FDCs: • Enhanced efficacy:  In some cases, combining specific drugs in a fixed ratio can achieve better therapeutic outcomes than using them individually. • Cost -effectiveness:  FDCs can sometimes be more affordable than purchasing individual medications separately, particularly in developing countries. • Reduced pill burden:  Taking fewer pills can improve convenience and patient compliance, especially for those with multiple chronic conditions. • Improved adherence:  Combining multiple medications into one pill can simplify treatment regimens, leading to improved medication adherence, especially for chronic conditions. • Improved patient convenience : Taking fewer pills can improve convenience and quality of life for patients,  especially those with multiple chronic conditions who might otherwise struggle with complex medication regimens. Issues associated with FDCs: • Lack of individual dose flexibility:  FDCs offer a fixed dose of each component, which may not be suitable for all patients, especially those requiring different dosages due to age, weight, or other factors. • Unapproved and Banned FDCs : The easy access to untested and unlicensed FDCs in countries like India creates a potentially hazardous situation for public health. o For example, a study conducted in Ahmedabad, revealed that FDCs containing banned or controversial ingredients are prescribed widely. • Increased risk of Anti -microbial Resistance (AMR) : Combining medications in FDCs raises the risk of adverse events and AMR due to potential interactions and overuse. • Reduced transparency and affordability concerns: In some cases, FDCs may be priced higher than their individual components, raising concerns in resource -limited settings. • Ethical concern: India imposed ban on certain FDCs, however, there is no ban on same drugs being exported to African or SAARC countries. Their export is deemed legal if the importing country has no objections. • Limited choice for patients:  The fixed combination may not always be the most suitable for individual patient needs, limiting treatment options.  105                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  Way Forward • Regulatory Stringency : CDSCO should enforce stringent guidelines for FDC approval to protect public health and ensure the efficacy and safety of drugs. • Evidence -Driven Authorization: Require robust scientific evidence of FDC efficacy and safety to prevent unjustifiable combinations and enhance regulatory scrutiny. • Therapeutic Justification: Grant approval for FDCs only when individual components offer clear therapeutic benefits, avoiding unnecessary amalgamations. • Surveillance Systems: Establish vigilant post -market monitoring mechanisms for prompt detection and resolution of FDC-related adverse effects, prioritizing public safety. • Export Control Stringency: Harmonize export policies with domestic regulations to prohibit the overseas export of domestically banned or restricted FDCs . • Advocate Transparency and Affordability: Promote openness and cost transparency, facilitating generic availability of FDCs to enhance affordability, particularly in resource -constrained regions. • Public Awareness: Educate healthcare professionals and the public on the judicious use of FDCs, promoting responsible medication practices."

208,8.1. MITAKSHARA LAW,"Why in the News? Supreme Court ruled that children born from void or voidable marriages  are legitimate for property inheritance  under the Hindu Succession Act (HSA), 1956  which recognizes Mitakshara Law . More on News • The court held that such children be treated as an extended family of a common ancestor  to decide a valid share in the property of the common ancestor. Mitakshara Law • It is one of the two major Hindu law schools (the other being Dayabhaga) that governs the succession of property in Hindu families. • It is based on the commentary on the Yajnavalkya Smriti , written by Vijnaneswara in the 12th century . • It recognizes the concept of coparcenary , which means that ancestral property is jointly held by all male members of the family , and they have equal rights in the property. • Coparcener has no absolute right to transfer his share  because his share is not definite or ascertainable as their shares fluctuate with the births and deaths of the coparceners. • According to this school, a woman could never become a coparcener . o However, the Hindu Succession (Amendment) Act, of 2005 empowered women to become a coparcener  like males in ancestral property. • It is prevalent throughout India , except in some eastern parts where Dayabhaga School is followed. • There are 4 sub -schools of Mitakshara Law : o Dravidian/Madras school of thought, o Maharashtra school of thought, o Banaras school of thought, o Mithila school of thought. o Punjab School Dayabhaga School of Thought • It is based mainly on the Yagnavalkya Smriti commented by Jimutuvahana. • Inheritance is based on the principle of spiritual benefit . It arises by pinda offering,  i.e., rice ball offering to deceased ancestors. • Followed in Bengal and some parts of Assam  only. • It has no sub -school . Mitakshara vs. Dayabhaga schools in coparcenary rights Mitakshara Schools  Dayabhaga School Mitakshara is an orthodox School  Dayabhaga is Reformist School Right of a son by birth in the ancestral property equals to the interest of his father.  Son is entitled to his ancestral property only on the death of his father. Son becomes coparcener right after his birth.  Son becomes coparcener by death of his father. Coparcenary right is applicable to the property of grandfather and great -grandfather.  Father is the absolute owner of his property in his lifetime. One cannot transfer his share to the third party as their share is not definite or ascertainable.  One can transfer his share as they are defined.    113                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  Related News Sapinda Marriages • Delhi High Court upheld the constitutional validity of the prohibition of marriage between ‘Sapindas’ under the Hindu Marriage Act (HMA), 1955. • The court also said that if the choice of a partner in a marriage is left unregulated , an incestuous relationship may gain legitimacy . • Section 5(v) of the HMA, 1955 prohibits  marriages between Sapindas, unless custom or usage governing each of them permits a marriage between the two. • Sapindas o Under the HMA, 1955 , Sapinda relationship  with any person extends as far as ✓ 3rd generation (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the mother , and ✓ 5th generation (inclusive) in the line of ascent through the father . ✓ The line is traced upwards in each case from the person concerned , who is to be counted as the first generation. o Two persons are said to be sapindas  of each other if – ✓ one is a lineal ascendant of the other  within the limits of the sapinda relationship , or ✓ they have a common lineal ascendant who is within the limits of the sapinda relationship  with reference to each of them."

228,9.1. BUDDHA'S TEACHINGS,"Why in the news? Recently, the Vice President of India stressed the importance of Buddha’s teachings while addressing the 12th General Assembly of the Asian Buddhist Conference for Peace (ABCP) . Important Teachings of Buddha • In the 6th century BC,  Buddha preached that life brings sorrow. To find freedom, one must overcome desire. • His teachings encompass  'Four Noble Truths' and 'Eight -Fold Path’ or Ashtangika Marg. • Four Noble Truths: o There is suffering  and the entire world is inflicted by it o There is a cause for suffering, which is not one entity, but a cycle of twelve links, with  ignorance being the root cause. o There is end of suffering  if the root cause of suffering, i.e., ignorance is dispelled. o There is a path that leads to the end of suffering , known  as the eight -fold path. • 'Eight -Fold Path’ (Path to the end of suffering): Right - Views, Aspiration, Speech, Action, Livelihood, Effort, Mindfulness and Concentration. • He advocated  a ‘Middle Path’, a simple, virtuous life between extreme austerity and luxury. • Further, Buddhist ethics, the expansion of the fourth noble truth,  prescribes  three gems (Triratna) -Knowledge, conduct and meditation as the means of liberation. • The five conducts that are very important for a Buddhist monk include : Non -violence, Non -stealing, Celibacy, Truthfulness and not taking any intoxicating things like liquor. Contemporary Relevance of Buddha’s Teachings • Addresses Consumerism and Materialistic Greed:  Buddha acknowledged the relationship between attachment and sorrow and inspired to follow the pursuit of inner contentment. o This can address mindless consumerism and promote sustainable consumption as envisioned in India’s Mission LiFE ( Lifestyle for Environment) . • Promoting Scientific temper: Encouraging  mindfulness, concentration, and right understanding can facilitate a spirit of inquiry. • Citizen -centric governance: Right Speech, conduct, and livelihood can help make administration more responsive and service -driven, prioritizing citizen welfare and inclusivity. o Also, the incorporation of ‘Right conduct’ among public servants can help address concerns related to corruption. • Forest Conservation : Buddhist monastic rules prohibit the cutting of plants and trees which recognizes sufferings associated with deforestation to habitat and indigenous communities. o Such recognition can help address contemporary forest degradation through  Community based forest management . • Sustainable development: Pursuit of  the 'Middle Path' can offer a path of sustainability, simplicity and moderation and be a solution to climate change, over -exploitation of resources, etc. o Pursuance of just and egalitarian society: Buddha preached non -discrimination by opening the  institution of Sangha to all persons (including courtesans like Amrapali) above fifteen years of age. o His teachings can help eliminate discrimination against vulnerable sections like sex workers, women, transgender, etc. • Peace, harmony, and coexistence: Spirit of love towards all living and emphasis on the law of karma  can curb wars, terrorism , extremism and violence. • Inter -faith harmony: Buddha neither accepted nor rejected the existence of God . He was more concerned about the individual and his actions. • Ethical guide:  There is rise of frontier technology  like Artificial Intelligence, biotechnology etc. o  Buddha’s teachings of simplicity, moderation, middle path and reverence for all life , guide us to deal with ethical ambiguity  associated with these advances. • Peaceful resolution of conflict:  Buddha rejected violence and taught dialogue  as best way to resolve conflicts. In his lifetime, Buddha resolved tensions between rulers of neighboring kingdoms. 118                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  Conclusion Buddha’s teachings have a non - anthropocentric approach  which focuses not only on human liberation by practicing moral disciplines but also on wellbeing of all creatures and the natural world ."
229,9.2. GOOD SAMARITANS,"Introduction In a case related to Good Samaritan, the Delhi High Court observed that a person who chooses to help a person in distress should not be harassed for showing kindness.  Further, HC said that helping an injured on a public road/highway is the prime duty of eve ryone. Stakeholders and their Interests Stakeholder  Interests Good Samaritan  • Responsibility and duty to help  living beings in distress. • Expect that in lieu of helping others they will be not harassed by authorities or bear prolonged legal formalities Person in need  • Expect that every person shall show the qualities of Good Samaritan  showering compassion and empathy. Government  • Government benefits from the act of Good Samaritans  as it leads to saving of life of citizens. o According to the Law Commission, 50% of the road accident victims could have been saved if they had received care on time especially during Golden hour. Golden Hour refers to time period of one hour following an accident. • It will help government in reducing the road accidents by 50% by 2030 . Police/Other authorities  • Collects all the relevant information from the Good Samaritan . • Also, makes effort that Good Samaritan are not harassed  by involving them in investigation, seeing them as suspect, forcing them to become eyewitness etc. Issues which hinder acts of Good Samaritan • Indifference: In times of need, people give priority to their interests in comparison to the urgency of saving a human life. o For instance, if an individual is going for an important business deal and s/he encounters an accident, the indifference can be reflected here. • Selfishness/unsympathetic: In modern times, self -centric tendencies have increased. E.g. In a recent accident, people were taking selfies and making videos instead of helping them. • Bystander apathy: leads to diffusion of responsibility  that occurs when multiple people are present believing that someone else will take the action. • Unfavourable public judgment: Fear of unfavourable public judgement wherein people feel they would be considered the culprit. • Legal Issues: Fear of being trapped in legal matters creates resistance among people to come forward and help others. o In many cases, it has been found that police harass Good Samaritans through different means such as asking them to take care of injured people, pay hospital bills, become eyewitnesses etc. Good Samaritan and Legal Provision in India • A person who comes forward  to administer immediate assistance  or emergency care to a person injured in an accident, or crash, or emergency medical condition, or emergency situation. Such act is performed voluntarily without expectation of payment  or reward  and without any duty of care or special relationship.  119                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  • Based on a PIL filed by Save LIFE Foundation , Supreme Court  directed the centre to issue guidelines. Ministry of Road Transport and Highways accordingly issued guidelines: - o Good Samaritan may take an injured person to the nearest hospital and should be allowed to leave immediately. o He/she shall not be liable for any civil and criminal liability. o Hospitals should publish a charter stating that they shall not detain Samaritan or ask for depositing money for the treatment . o Action against public officials who coerce Good Samaritan for revealing personal details. • In 2016, Supreme Court  made these guidelines legally binding  for all states and Union Territories. • Section 134A  was inserted in Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Act, 2019  providing protection to Good Samaritans How we can promote the culture of Good Samaritan in India? • Reforms in Law:  Stringent provisions in Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 can be added for the protection of the Good Samaritan. o It will motivate people to come forward and help others. • Display ‘Charter of Rights’ for Good Samaritans in the hospitals and police stations, as mandated by the Supreme Court. • Rewards/Recognition for Good Samaritans: Operant conditioning, also referred to as instrumental conditioning  or Skinnerian conditioning, can be used in this regard. o It is a method of learning that uses rewards and punishment to modify behaviour. • Public Awareness:  It will help in promoting values like empathy, kindness , and the importance of helping others from a young age. o Familiarise Health Workers and Police about the Good Samaritan Law, court decisions, guidelines and standard operating procedures o Different mediums can be adopted for it such as cinema, theatre etc. • Adoption of Best Practices: Canadian states have provisions of no liability for emergency aid by Samaritans unless gross negligence is observed.

Why do some well -bred animals are seen as status symbols, and treated like family members, while others living on the streets are seen as social outcasts ? • Companionship and responsibility:  Dogs have a unique relationship with man’s evolutionary history — one of companionship. This poses a moral dilemma of being responsible for their welfare  but also confronting the vagaries of their evolution from wolves and their territorial instincts . • Public Health:  The concern is raised for both human health and the health of dogs. o Also, India has committed to eliminating rabies by 2030, but it is not possible without first addressing threats from stray dogs. • Ecological concerns: Carrying capacity of the environment is the population of a species that can be supported by a particular environment given the limite resources. o Some believe that humans are directly increasing the capacity of stray dog population  by regularly feeding them, thus aggravating the problem. • Animal control methods: The use of capture, mass killing and euthanasia methods raises ethical concerns, as it involves taking the lives of animals. Ethical alternatives, such as trap -neuter -return (TNR) programs, should be considered. Present Policy Framework • Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (PCA), 1960: Killing  of stray dogs is punishable  under the PCA, 1960, which classifies torture and transporting them in a manner which causes them suffering, as cruelty. • Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI):  A statutory advisory body, established in 1962 under PCA 1960, to promote animal welfare. • Animal Birth Control (ABC) Program:  It aims to control population of stray dogs through sterilization and vaccination. The program is regulated as per the Animal Birth Control Rules, 2023  under PCA 1960, other provisions of which include: o ABC programme is to be carried out by the respective local bodies/municipalities/Municipal Corporations and Panchayats . o Incurably ill and mortally wounded dogs shall be euthanized  in a humane manner. o Responsibility of feeding the community animals  lies with the Resident Welfare Association or Local Body’s representative of that area. • Judicial View:  Supreme Court has in various orders specifically mentioned that relocation of dogs cannot be permitted . o Supreme Court in AWBI vs Nagaraja case (2014) declared that every species has a right to life and security , subject to the law of the land, which includes depriving its life out of human necessity. Different ethical perspectives for building a way forward • Utilitarianism:  Utilitarian views of greater benefit to society would support a pro -human strategy for dog management. • Deontology:  Deontology involves approaches that prioritize fulfilling responsibilities toward animals, such as providing proper care and respecting the inherent value of life. • Virtue Ethics:  It involves promoting virtues such as empathy, compassion, and encouraging responsible pet ownership. • Rights -based Ethics:  Stray dogs would be considered as having certain rights, and ethical actions would involve respecting and protecting those rights. • Libertarian view:  Removal of dogs from our surroundings and dumping them in garbage mounds violates their fundamental right to life and dignity.  121                                                                                          www.visionias.in                                                                                    ©Vision IAS  Way Forward • Animal control measures:  Government alongside Civil Society needs to formulate and implement policy measures including proper vaccination and sterilization drives and manage animal waste. o Effective laws to prevent the abandonment of pets and ensure their welfare can also be enacted. o A national policy aiming to solve the human -dog conflict  with a focus on block and district levels should be designed with consultation from all relevant stakeholders. • Infrastructural support:  Creation of dedicated feeding spots, veterinary healthcare facilities, and support to civil society organizations involved in animal welfare. • Training and Education: Potential/present pet owners shall be educated and trained regarding pet behaviour, their development cycle and managing their health and hygiene. • Developing new relationships:  Dogs have highly developed cognitive and social communication abilities, which enable them to perform various functions in the roles of service dogs, drug -detecting, and bomb -sniffing dogs and so on. o Also, many studies demonstrate that the company of dogs can lead to reduced stress, anxiety, and symptoms of depression.
